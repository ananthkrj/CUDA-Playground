# CUDA-Playground
Implemented my own kernels that accomplish Vector Addiction, elementiwse matrix multiplication, naive + tiled matmult, and a 2d stencil operation.
Implementing all of these was cummalative learning, to make more advanced projects with cuda and optimization in general. 2d Stencil was quite important,
to develop my Laplacian Convolution kernel.
